## Clustering Lab

The Clustering lab created a k-means cluster using three features: boosts, matchkillrank, and walkdistance

At the end of the lab you were asked to create your own clustering example using at least 5 features.

Create an ipython notebook whose name begins with YourWSUID_Clustering_Lab-01. Explore the pubg dataset. Identify 5 features you find (mildly) interesting, and create a k-means clustering using these features. Visualize the data by reducing to 2 dimensions with PCA.
